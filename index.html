    <p>
      <b>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar</b>:(born 24 April 1973) is a former
      international cricketer from India and a former captain of the Indian
      national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the
      history of cricket. He is the highest run scorer of all time in
      International cricket. Considered as the world's most prolific batsman of
      all time,[6] he is the only player to have scored one hundred
      international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a
      One Day International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in
      both Test and ODI cricket, and the only player to complete more than
      30,000 runs in international cricket.

      Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15
      November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went
      on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to
      twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers'
      Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind
      Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv
      Richards.[8] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team
      that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances
      for India.[9] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at
      the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa. In 2013, he was
      the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to
      mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. He is
      colloquially known as Little Master or Master Blaster.<i
